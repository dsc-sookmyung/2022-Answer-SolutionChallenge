## 💡 Project Introduction

**Notinote** helps parents of multicultural families read school newsletters more easily. The school letters are considered one of the most difficult documents for the parents to read because they use more complex words than everyday. Therefore, we would like to make it possible for the parents to understand the letters with only one app service instead of asking teachers every time, or paying for translation.

With Notinote, parents of multicultural families can read school newsletters in their own language in just 5 minutes. They don’t have to pay a fee or wait a day to translate the newsletters. In addition, Notinote recognizes event words from the newsletters automatically and helps them manage their children’s schedules in Google Calendar. The parents no longer have to worry that their children will suffer because they don’t understand the school newsletters.
